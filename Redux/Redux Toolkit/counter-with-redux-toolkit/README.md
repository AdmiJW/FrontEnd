# Counter with Redux Toolkit

A React Counter application that has absolutely no value. It is created to simply practice and get accustomed with the
usage of redux toolkit.

The application contains 3 counters:
* One single digit (Decade) counter - 0 to 9, then loop back to 0
* One alphabetic counter - A to Z, then loop back to A
* One asynchronous counter - Counter only updates after 3 seconds. Used to learn `createAsyncThunk`.
